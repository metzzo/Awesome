# Philsophy
Awesome is a language designed to be awesome. It's main goal is to be a general purpose language that allows programmers to concentrate on what they want to program rather than what they are programming in.
This means Awesome tries to be as "silent" as possible, only state meta information if needed but on the other hand do not over exaggerate, Awesome tries to find a nice balance between abstraction, implicit and explicit information.

## Concepts
### DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself is a concept Awesome is embracing, but does not follow it religiously. For example: Implicit typing is a feature that is very handy and useful for programmers, but if someone wants to explicitely define a type of a variable it is also possible. Other cases are variable definitions: "var i = 10" the keyword var is not particularly necessary, but it prevents common errors and therefore is forced.
